High density according to Ramsey Lewis.",,"*Selected 10 plants per block in 2021, potentialy due to severe lodging. Also, their plot design was such that it amplified edge effects and competion.","*Sample size varies from 180 in the methods to 20-44 in Tables S1-S5, probably because some of the 180 samples were used for destructive sampling. Altmetric score potentially skewed by my tweets.","*Sample size of 150 is from the methods section, however, in main figure 7F it says the sample size is >30. The data was not available in the supplimental tables so the Plot Digitizer online software was used to estimate the mean values. Altmetric score skewed by my tweets. Density low according to Mark Sorrells.","*while plants were directly seeded into the soil, they were grown in growth chambers for all yield estimates. Nipponbare is elite in terms of grain quality - for yield its an older variety. ","Since this was a natural variation allele, no empty vector/null-allele could be tested. Normal planting density according to Mark Sorrells. Measured inbred yield, however, there was a potential boost in yield due to heterosis in F4 population","*=BLUPs were made to do QTL mapping for Kernel Row number, it is unknown and unclear if this was done for all other phenotypes for either maize or rice.","*=BLUPs were made to do QTL mapping for Kernel Row number, it is unknown and unclear if this was done for all other phenotypes for either maize or rice. Phenotypes were not available in supplimental data so I used plot digitizer on the main figure for rice, since no plot size information was available, I dropped it from the yield figure.  Nipponbare is elite in terms of grain quality - for yield its an older variety. ","*For WT versus null-construct, in the methods it is unclear what the wild type actually is. For the yield data, I will only analyze the T3 data, as the T2 data has many more issues going on with variable plot sizes. Things are much more consistent with the T3 data. It is still unclear if in the T3 generation, some things  were measured as two or four row plots. Low planting density according to Mark Sorrells.",Nipponbare is elite in terms of grain quality - for yield its an older variety. Zhonghua 11 has no yield trial information readily available.,*used plot digitizer to get data. Variety has little information about it. Density low according to Walter De Jong.,*>35% because no full range was provided and no raw data was available to caluclate this range manually. Second * = lines were selfed for one generation and backcrossed another generation (BC1S1). Low density according to Nick Lepack.,"*No backcrossing, however, hybrids were made with multiple lines. Number of exact years was hard to discern from the text, we are assuming it is one year with two locations (Wuhan and Linshui). Plot yield was measured for three different testers, only the genotype with significant results was put into the main paper - other two genotypes are in the suppliment.","*breeding methodologoes to stack QTL provided a yield increase of 23-34%, however, they did not include the CKX2 anitsense transformed line. Also, no experimental design data or yield data was available to collect. Both lines are elite in terms of grain quality, but we're unsure of they are compeititve in terms of yield because they are older.",*used plot digitizer for Fig2C.
